 * For extra-credit:

Create a class that allows a user to parse an arbitrarily large Fasta file
one sequence at a time but does not hold the sequences in memory.

This class should have a function called something like

	public FastaSequence getNextSequence()

that returns the next FastaSequence in the file or null if there are
no more sequencesâ€¦
