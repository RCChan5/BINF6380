/*
 * For extra-credit:

Create a class that allows a user to parse an arbitrarily large Fasta file
one sequence at a time but does not hold the sequences in memory.

This class should have a function called something like

	public FastaSequence getNextSequence()

that returns the next FastaSequence in the file or null if there are
no more sequencesâ€¦

/*
 * since FileReader can read one line at a time and basically keep its location while iterating through a text file.
 * I use that to and make it so that an object stores the FileReader object. Due to how fasta files are, i need a way to check 
 * when the sequence ends and while using FileReader which just iterates through so i wont be able to get the next seqID unless i 
 * move within the position of the text file hence why I used a variable to store seq ID's 
 * 
 * by doing this I can add methods like getCurrentSequence()
 * 
 * 2 objects are being used in this program the first is an object of the extracredit class and this instance holds the iterator for the fasta file
 * and the brains for knowing when to stop or not the other is the fastasequnce instance which holds the header and seq which is returned when getNextFasta
 * is called
